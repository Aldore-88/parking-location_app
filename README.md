WHAT I WANT TO DO
CREATE A PARKING SERVICE APP, that utilizes the Melbourne CBD parking locations. Integrating with Google maps/or just any maps?

Implementation of google maps - implenetation is doable, making locations is good
1 - marking locations on the google maps of all locations that are free -> using the lat/log coordinates from the json
- coloured location markers depending on duration?? -> current time minus the sensor trigger time

Access Melbourne CBD parking location API, and see what it gives me
1 - Accessed - is there a max limit to how often this can be called before being blocked?
- updater, to current data that is stored. Updating the locations that have been triggered every (5min?)

Database to collect the status of the locations of Melbourne CBD parking locations
- Use Json file to start with
- testing on local first
- how do i have this run and track data over time? onto a proper database host?

Location caluclation to only display those parking locations that are within a distance away from a set location.
